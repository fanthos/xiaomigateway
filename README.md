# xiaomigateway
The HomeAssiatant custom component. Uses python-miio package ( Vers.  >= 0.3.7 ) (https://github.com/rytilahti/python-miio/).
Allows you to manage the following devices connected to the XiaomiGateway:
- Lamp "Aqara LED Light Bulb (ZNLDP12LM)". Identifier in "MiHome": 'lumi.light.aqcn02'.
  Supports brightness and color temperature control.
- Two-channel relay "Aqara (LLKZMK11LM)". The identifier in "MiHome" is 'lumi.relay.c2acn01'.
  Support: Control channel_1 and channel_2, CURRENT_POWER, POWER_CONSUMED
- XiaomiGateway FM Radio.
  Support: Turn on/off, sound control (including MUTE), next station, previous station,
  flexible setting of stations, including favorites from "MiHome", select stations from the list.
  Because in the new version of firmware not working the command 
  '"method":'play_specify_fm' "params": {"id": xxx,"type": 0,"url":"http://your_arbitrary_link/file.m3u8"'
  The command is perceived, but the stream is not played. This capability is left, but performance is not guaranteed.

UPD: Automatic device inspection (ZNLDP12LM and LLKZMK11LM only)
